# DiscoPoP - Discovery of Potential Parallelism
DiscoPoP is an open-source tool that helps software developers parallelize their programs with threads. It is a joint project of Technical University of Darmstadt and Iowa State University. 

In a nutshell, DiscoPoP performs the following steps:
* detect parts of the code (computational units or CUs) with little to no internal parallelization potential,
* find data dependences among them,
* identify parallel patterns that can be used to parallelize a code region,
* and finally suggest corresponding OpenMP parallelization constructs and clauses to programmers.

DiscoPoP is built on top of LLVM. Therefore, DiscoPoP can perform the above-mentioned steps on any source code which can be transferred into the LLVM IR.

A more comprehensive overview of DiscoPoP can be found on our [project website](https://www.discopop.tu-darmstadt.de/).
