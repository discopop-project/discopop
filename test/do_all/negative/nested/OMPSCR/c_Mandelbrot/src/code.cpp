  DESCRIPTION:       This program computes an estimation to the
                           Mandelbrot Set area using MonteCarlo sampling.
                                                                                 The best known estimate so far is 1.50659177 +- 0.00000008.
  COMMENTS:	         The Mandelbrot set is a fractal that is defined as the
set of points c in the complex plane for which the sequence z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
                     with z_0 = 0 does not tend to infinity.
                     The area of the Mandelbrot set is an open question that has
been discussed in the recent past. It is not easy to obtain an accurate
analytical estimate, and therefore statistical methods have been used. The
program explores the rectangle ranging over (-2.0, 0.5) in the real axis and
(0.0, 1.125) in the imaginary axis. This rectangle covers the top half of the
Mandelbrot Set. REFERENCES:
