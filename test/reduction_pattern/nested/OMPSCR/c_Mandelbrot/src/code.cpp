  VERSION:           1.0
  DATE:              May 2004
  AUTHOR:            F. de Sande
  COMMENTS TO:       sande@csi.ull.es
  DESCRIPTION:       This program computes an estimation to the 
	                   Mandelbrot Set area using MonteCarlo sampling.
										 The best known estimate so far is 1.50659177 +- 0.00000008.
  COMMENTS:	         The Mandelbrot set is a fractal that is defined as the set of points c
	                   in the complex plane for which the sequence z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
                     with z_0 = 0 does not tend to infinity.
                     The area of the Mandelbrot set is an open question that has been 
										 discussed in the recent past.
                   	 It is not easy to obtain an accurate analytical estimate, and therefore 
										 statistical methods have been used.
	                   The program explores the rectangle ranging over (-2.0, 0.5) in the 
	                   real axis and (0.0, 1.125) in the imaginary axis.
										 This rectangle covers the top half of the Mandelbrot Set.
