# DiscoPoP Setup - Package
- Proposed method of installation for `users` of DiscoPoP
- Download the `.deb` package of choice from [releases](https://github.com/discopop-project/discopop/releases).
    - Packages for different targets and configurations might become available in the future
- Install via a package manager of choice (example: `sudo apt install ./<packagename>.deb`)
- Uninstall via a package manager of choice (example: `sudo apt remove discopop`)


# DiscoPoP Setup - Manual
- Proposed method of installation for `developers` of DiscoPoP
## Prerequisites
- LLVM/clang version 11
- Python version 3.6 or greater

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:discopop-project/discopop.git
cd discopop
mkdir build
```

## Build libraries and install Python modules
```
cd build
cmake .. <CMAKE_FLAGS>
make
make python_modules
cd ..
```

where `<CMAKE_FLAGS>` can consist of any combination of the following flags and commonly used CMAKE_FLAGS:
#### Environment configuration
- `-DUSE_LLVM_VERSION=<version>` &ndash; Use a specific Version of LLVM
- `-DLLVM_DIST_PATH=<llvm_base_dir>` &ndash; Use a specific LLVM installation by specifiying the location
#### Profiling configuration
- `-DDP_PTHREAD_COMPATIBILITY_MODE=[0|1]` &ndash; If your application uses PThreads, please specify this flag to serialize the calls to the DiscoPoP runtime functions. Note, however, that this can negatively influence the runtime of the profiling. Default: `0`.
- `-DDP_NUM_WORKERS=<int>` &ndash; Specify the number of worker threads available for the dependency analysis during profiling. Default: `3` worker threads. `0` can be used to disable the creation of additional threads for the analysis.
- `-DDP_HYBRID_PROFILING=[0|1]` &ndash; Enbale hybrid profiling. Default: `1`.
- `-DDP_CALLTREE_PROFILING=[0|1]` &ndash; Enable creation of a call tree during profiling to create extended dependency metadata for improved result quality. Negatively impacts profiling performance. Default: `0`.
- `-DDP_CALLTREE_PROFILING_METADATA_CUTOFF=<int>` &ndash; Set a cutoff amount of vitis per basic block for dependency metadata calculation. Set `0` to disable cutoff. Default: `50`.
- `-DDP_CALLTREE_PROFILING_METADATA_CUTOFF_IGNORE_PROBABILITY=[0-1000]` &ndash; Enable or disable probablistic cutoff. Ignores cutoff with a configurable probability. Set `0` to disable probabilistic cutoff. Set `25` for a probability of 2.5% etc. Default: `1`.
- `-DDP_MEMORY_REGION_DEALIASING=[0|1]`: Enable or disable the generation of dependency de-aliasing information. Reduces potential false positive parallelization suggestions, but increases the profiling overhead. Default: `0`.
- `-DDP_BRANCH_TRACKING=[0|1]`: Toggles the creation of instrumentation calls for tracking taken branches. Required by the graph pruning step of the DiscoPoP optimizer. Default: `0`.

#### Development and debugging
- `-DDP_RTLIB_VERBOSE=[0|1]` &ndash; Enable verbose output during profiling.
- `-DDP_INTERNAL_TIMER=[0|1]`&ndash; Enable timing of runtime library functions.
- `-DDP_BUILD_UNITTESTS=[0|1]`&ndash; Enable building unittests and performance benchmarks. Default: `0`.



## Testing the installation
To test the installation, it is possible to execute the provided set of unit tests.
```
cd <dp_source_dir>
venv/bin/python -m unittest -v
```
