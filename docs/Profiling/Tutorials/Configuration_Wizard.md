# Configuration Wizard

## Important Note
If you want to make use of the [Configuration](Configuration_Wizard.md) or [Execution Wizard](Execution_Wizard.md) for a simplified analysis of your project, you additionally need a working installation of [gllvm](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/gllvm) and [go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
