# DiscoPoP - Discovery of Potential Parallelism
DiscoPoP is an open-source tool that helps software developers parallelize their programs with threads. It is a joint project of Technical University of Darmstadt and Iowa State University. 

In a nutshell, DiscoPoP performs the following steps:
* detect parts of the code (computational units or CUs) with little to no internal parallelization potential,
* find data dependences among them,
* identify parallel patterns that can be used to parallelize a code region,
* and finally suggest corresponding OpenMP parallelization constructs and clauses to programmers.

DiscoPoP is built on top of LLVM. Therefore, DiscoPoP can perform the above-mentioned steps on any source code which can be transferred into the LLVM IR.

A more comprehensive overview of DiscoPoP can be found on our [project website](https://www.discopop.tu-darmstadt.de/).

## Getting started
For detailed instructions regarding the initial setup, please refer to the [initial setup](Setup.md) page.
A short summary of the necessary steps can be found on the [TL;DR setup](TLDR/Setup.md) page.

## Running the DiscoPoP Profiler


## Pattern identfication
Once you have all the results generated by DiscoPoP passes, you can use them to identify possible parallel design patterns. To learn more, please read the pattern detection [README](/discopop_explorer/README.md), which explains how to run pattern identification in detail.

## Walk-through example
In the `test/` folder, we have provided sample programs to help you start using DiscoPoP. You can find the walk-through example [here](Tutorial.md).
