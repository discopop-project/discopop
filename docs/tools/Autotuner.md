# DiscoPoP Empirical Autotuner
## Executable
`discopop_auto_tuner`

## Purpose
Identify the best configuration of parallel code which is achievable by applying a combination of the parallelization suggestion found by the [DiscoPoP Explorer](../tools/Explorer.md) or [optimizer](../tools/Optimizer.md). Internally, the [DiscoPoP patch applicator](../tools/Patch_applicator.md) is used to create different parallel codes, which will be compiled, executed, and evaluated based on the observed execution time and result validity.

## Search algorithms
The search algorithm is selected with `-A/--algorithm`. Note that the default, `-A 0`, does **not** combine suggestions: it measures every suggestion on its own.

| `-A` | Algorithm | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `0`  | No combination (measure only) | Default. Measures each suggestion individually. |
| `1`  | Linear combination | Accumulates suggestions that keep the result valid; does not require a speedup. |
| `3`  | Evolutionary combination | Genetic search. Uses randomness, so results are not reproducible. |
| `4`  | Greedy forward search | One pass over all suggestions, `O(N)` evaluations. |
| `5`  | Coordinate descent | Repeated bit-flip passes until no pass improves the runtime. |
| `6`  | Hotspot-guided region descent | Deterministic. Requires hotspot detection results. |

### Hotspot-guided region descent (`-A 6`)
This algorithm spends its measurements on the code regions that dominate the measured runtime, and makes every decision from sorted data so that two runs on a machine with stable timings produce the same sequence of measured configurations.

- Require hotspot detection results. Without `Hotspots.json` the algorithm stops with a message instead of falling back to treating every suggestion as a hotspot.
- Collect the hot loops of the requested `--hotspot-types` and the suggestions that parallelize them. Loops whose longest measured run is below `--hs-min-share` of the hottest loop's are dropped, so a cold loop never costs a compile-and-execute cycle.
- Rank the remaining regions by hotspot class (`YES`, then `MAYBE`, then `NO`) and, within a class, by their longest measured run. The class already combines both quantities of interest: the hotspot detection derives it from the region's average runtime *and* its scaling behaviour across the profiled input sizes. The longest run is preferred over the average because it describes the largest-input regime, which is where parallel speedup matters.
- Arrange the regions into a nesting forest and try the outermost region of each nest first. Hotspot runtimes are inclusive, so a hot loop and the loops nested inside it report nearly the same time; accepting the outer one therefore skips its whole subtree, which avoids nested parallel regions and the measurements they would cost. Only if the outer region does not pay off does the search descend one level.
- Accept a suggestion only if the code stays valid *and* the runtime improves by more than `--noise-threshold`. Every configuration is measured at most once and remembered, so measurement noise below the threshold cannot flip a decision.
- Finally, re-check whether any accepted suggestion can be removed again -- a suggestion accepted early was judged against a smaller configuration than the final one. Disable this pass with `--skip-removal-pass`.

`--max-measurements` caps the number of compile-and-execute cycles. Note that a search stopped by that cap, by the internal time limit or by `CTRL+C` is no longer reproducible, and the tuner says so in its log.

For meaningful scaling information the hotspot detection should be run for at least two input sizes. With a single run the scaling ratio is constant, the hotspot classification degenerates to a single threshold on the average runtime, and the ranking reduces to plain descending runtime order. The tuner warns when it detects this.

## Required input
- `Parallel patterns` in the form of a `JSON` file, created by the [Explorer](Explorer.md)
- `Detected hotspots` in the form of a `JSON` file, created by the [Hotspot detection](https://github.com/discopop-project/Hotspot-Detection)
- `Prepared patch files` created by the [DiscoPoP patch generator](Patch_generator.md)
- An `execution configuration` created by the [project manager](Project_manager.md), which provides the `compile.sh` and `execute.sh` scripts used to compile and execute the created parallel code. Its optional `validate.sh` validates the results, and its optional `compile_validate.sh` builds the code that `validate.sh` runs whenever validation requires a different build than the timed execution.

## Output
The parallel code representing the identified best configuration will be stored in a copy of the project directory.
Information on the configuration can be found in the included `.discopop` directory.

## Limitations
Due to the empirical nature of the optimization approach described above, varying sets of input data might yield differing selected configurations.
For this reason it is important, that the used input data (typically specified in `execute.sh`) is representative for a production run of the software and large enough to allow for beneficial parallelizations.
