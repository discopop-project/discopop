# DiscoPoP explorer
## Executable
`discopop_explorer`

## Purpose
Analyze the [output of the instrumentation and profiling stage](../data/Profiling_and_instrumentation_output.md) in order to identify opportunities for parallelism in the sequential target code ([parallel patterns](../data/Parallel_patterns.md)).
As part of the analysis, the [program execution graph](../data/Program_execution_graph.md) is created.

## Required input
- [Filemapping](../data/Filemapping.md)
- [Profiling and instrumentation output](../data/Profiling_and_instrumentation_output.md)

## Output
Identified [parallel patterns](../data/Parallel_patterns.md) are stored in a file named `.discopop/explorer/patterns.json` by default. This information can be imported by various other tools in the framework.

## Note
For a more detailed description of the available run-time arguments, please refer to the help string of the respective tool.
```
discopop_explorer --help
```

## Background
Please note that like many scientific applications which work on arrays or matrices, the suggestions do not change if we change the input size. Thus, it is possible to analyze the program with small inputs, obtain the parallelization suggestions and execute the parallelized version with larger inputs. However, this is a recommendation merely and it being applicable or not depends highly on the code.

Furthermore, we need to mention that DiscoPoP has an optimistic approach towards parallelization and thus programmers require to validate the final suggestions.
