# Tools
DiscoPoP consists of several tools. Each tool reads the files of the previous one from the `.discopop` directory of your project and writes its own results back into it. The tools work on this directory and are run from inside it (`cd .discopop`), unless they take a path option such as `--path` or `--dot-dp-path`.

1. You compile your program with the [compiler wrappers](Instrumentation.md) and run it. The instrumented program writes the profiling data to `.discopop/profiler`.
2. Optionally, you build the program with the [hotspot detection](Hotspot_detection.md) wrappers, run it with several inputs and analyze the runs. This creates `.discopop/hotspot_detection/Hotspots.json`.
3. The [Explorer](Explorer.md) detects parallel patterns and writes them to `.discopop/explorer/patterns.json`. It also creates the [patches](Patch_generator.md) in `.discopop/patch_generator/`.
4. Optionally, [patch repair](Patch_repair.md) lets an LLM agent fix patches that do not compile.
5. The [empirical autotuner](Autotuner.md) measures which suggestions pay off and writes the result to `.discopop/auto_tuner/results.json`.
6. The [patch applicator](Patch_applicator.md) applies the selected patches to your source code.

The [project manager](Project_manager.md) and the [GUI](GUI.md) store how your project is built and executed (*execution configurations*) and run these steps for you. The [MCP server](MCP_server.md) offers the same pipeline to LLM agents. All three use the same configurations below `.discopop/project`.
