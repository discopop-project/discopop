"""Regression tests for the TaskGraph construction passes in TaskGraph.py.

test_branch_point_* cover __add_branching_nodes_for_function's dominance-based
region wrapping. Both reproduce shapes that previously let a
TGStartBranchParentNode/TGEndBranchParentNode end up with zero successors/
predecessors - an orphaned node that later crashed __calculate_context_nesting
because it looks like a valid entry point despite being an "exit" marker.

test_visit_pet_* / test_break_cycles_* cover __visit_pet's control-flow
reconstruction, where a dropped successor edge made __break_cycles misidentify a
loop's header (see INVARIANTS.md, invariant 1).

test_calculate_context_successions_* cover the pass that links sibling contexts
into sequences, in particular that a context's sibling survives an arbitrarily
nested context in between (that is what the ContextStack it carries is for).

test_validate_graph_structure_* cover the acyclicity check that runs once cycle
breaking and loop unrolling are done (INVARIANTS.md, invariant 4).

test_validate_context_structure_* cover the Context relation checks that run
after __calculate_context_successions."""
