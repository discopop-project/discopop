        Clang sometimes records source file paths as bare filenames (e.g. ``test.cpp``)

        the discrepancy by suffix-matching each AST path against the FileMapping
        entries: a FileMapping path ``/a/b/test.cpp`` is considered a match for the
        AST path ``test.cpp`` because the former ends with ``/test.cpp``.
