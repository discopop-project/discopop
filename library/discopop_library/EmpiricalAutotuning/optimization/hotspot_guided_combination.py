"""Deterministic, hotspot-guided selection of parallelization suggestions.

The search walks the code regions that dominate the measured runtime first and
descends into nested regions only where the enclosing region did not pay off. Every
decision is derived from sorted data, so two runs on a machine with stable timings
produce the same sequence of measured configurations.

Ranking uses the hotspot analyzer's own classification as the primary key. That
classification already combines both quantities of interest: ``hotness`` is derived
from ``topAvr`` (average runtime above the mean of all executed regions) and
``topRatio`` (scaling indicator above the mean), with YES = both, MAYBE = exactly
one, NO = neither. Within a class, regions are ordered by ``maxVal`` -- the longest
single profiling run, i.e. the largest-input regime where parallel speedup matters --
rather than by ``avr``, which dilutes a large run against a small one.
