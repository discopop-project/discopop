"""Structured progress channel for the empirical autotuner.

The autotuner emits one JSON object per search event via :class:`ProgressReporter`.
Each event is both

* printed to **stdout**, prefixed with :data:`PROGRESS_PREFIX`, so a consumer that
  already streams the autotuner's stdout (e.g. the Project Manager GUI) can update
  a live plot without extra IPC, and
* appended to a **``progress.jsonl``** file (one object per line) so the run can be
  re-visualized afterwards without re-running.

Event kinds (field ``event``):

* ``baseline``    -- the untuned reference measurement (``par_settings.json``).
* ``measurement`` -- one measured configuration, in search order. Carries
  ``application_failed`` / ``failed_suggestions`` when the configuration's patches
  could not be applied, in which case no runtime was measured at all.
* ``generation``  -- one evolutionary generation summary (evolutionary only).
* ``result``      -- the final best configuration + run statistics.

The reference for speedups is the *full-parallel* reference configuration, so
``speedup = reference_runtime / runtime`` is a speedup relative to full
parallelization, not to sequential execution.

``ProgressList`` is a drop-in replacement for the ``debug_stats`` list used
throughout the optimization algorithms: appending an entry additionally emits a
``measurement`` event via the process-global active reporter. This keeps the
step-based algorithms (greedy, coordinate descent, linear, measure-only, single
combination) unchanged -- they already append every measured configuration to
``debug_stats``.
