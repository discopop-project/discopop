"""Pure data-reduction helpers for the results plots.

Everything here is free of Tk and matplotlib so it can be unit-tested directly.
Two data sources are handled:

* ``execution_results.json`` (Report tab) -- nested ``config -> script -> setting
  -> [executions]``; flattened into :class:`ExecutionRecord`s with derived speedup
  and efficiency (relative to the ``seq`` baseline of the same config+script).
* the autotuner progress stream (Autotuning tab) -- ``@@AT_PROGRESS`` stdout lines
  and ``progress.jsonl``; parsed into plain event dicts, plus a ``best_so_far``
  convergence series.
